Welcome to the snare student evaluator. This tool has been trained on a dataset of students which consists of their academic performance, extracirricular activities, and academic/parental support systems.

---

For this solution, we employed the use of 3 different classification models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. The models were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the validation dataset, and the best model was selected based on the evaluation metrics.
